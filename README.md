# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

A machine learning model to classify tweets as related to real disasters or not, using a dataset of over 10,000 tweets
Preprocessed the tweets by applying techniques such as stemming, lemmatization, and stopword removal, resulting in a cleaner dataset
Developed and fine-tuned a BERT-based classification model, optimizing parameters to achieve an average validation accuracy of 84.8%
Performed 5-fold cross-validation with StratifiedKFold, producing out-of-fold (OOF) prediction accuracy of 89.5% and an F1 score of 0.91
